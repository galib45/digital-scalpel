- SBP ≥ 140 to < 160, DBP ≥ 90 to < 110 (two readings, 4 hours apart)
- Significant proteinuria (≥ 300mg in 24 hrs)
- No evidence of organ dysfunction

### Management

#### Admission

#### Quantification of Proteinuria (24 hrs urinary total protein)

#### Monitoring of Maternal Condition
- BP - 4 times a day
- CBC, S. creatinine, S. electrolytes, ALT, S. bilirubin - twice a week
- Examination of the retina

#### Monitoring of the Fetal Condition
- Kick count - daily
- USG to determine fetal growth - every 3 weeks

#### Control of BP
- BP < 150/100 - no antihypertensive
- BP ≥ 150/100 - oral labetalol 100 mg BD/TDS

#### Deliver if
- At term
- Signs of fetal growth restriction
- Worsening fetal or maternal condition
- Labor or rupture of membranes

## Severe Pre-eclampsia

### Criteria
- SBP ≥ 160, DBP ≥ 110 (two separate readings, 4 hours apart)
- Significant proteinuria (≥ 300 mg in 24 hours) or any evidence of organ dysfunction, e.g., low platelet count, elevated liver enzymes, pulmonary edema, creatinine ≥ 1.1 mg/dl, headache, blurring of vision.

### Management

#### Admission

#### If ≥ 34 weeks or < 34 weeks with complications
Deliver after stabilization of maternal condition.

#### If < 34 weeks without any complications
- Quantification of proteinuria
- Monitoring of fetal & maternal condition
- Control of BP by oral labetalol
- Prophylactic dose of MgSO4 (10gm)

## Plan of Delivery in Both Cases
- Assess cervical status
- If favorable, induce labor with ARM or oxytocin
- If unfavorable:
  - Ripen the cervix with misoprostol or Foley's catheter and then induce labor
  - Cesarean section
